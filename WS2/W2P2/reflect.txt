I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my
professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

I got a lot of problems in this workshop about rule of five and memory leak 
again. Here are something that I found I need to learn more after this workshop.

- Rule of 5:
	+ Destructor
	+ Copy Constructor
	+ Copy Assignment Operator
	+ Move Constructor
	+ Move Assignment Operator
I have ever done some workshop with rule of 3 but move constructor and move 
assignment operator are quite new to me and it took me some time to get familiar 
with them.

- Reading Input File:
	At first, I just count the number of airports and again to populate the 
dynamic array. Although this approach works, it involves reading the file twice 
so it may not be efficient for large files. After that, I tried to use seakg 
function to reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file after you have 
counted the number of airports in the file so it would avoid reread the file.

- std::chrono library:
    The use of std::chrono to measure time was an important concept. 
    The difference between steady_clock and system_clock is in their behavior 
when the system time is adjusted. 
	+ steady_clock is not affected by system time changes and is suitable 
for measuring intervals or durations. 
	+ system_clock can be adjusted due to changes in the system time, making 
it suitable for measuring real-world timestamps.
