I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my
professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

1. - Why the definitions and implementations in this case should be included 
in header file? 
Because we have templates in these modules and templates are not compiled 
until they are instantiated with specific types. The compiler needs access 
to the template's full definition (both declaration and implementation) to 
generate the specialized code for the specific types you use during instantiation.
- Are there ways to work around and include implementation in .cpp files?
I think we can explicitly instantiate the template for specific types in .cpp 
file. This involves specifying the types we want to use with the template and 
then including the template's implementation in the .cpp file. But it can lead 
to code bloat if you explicitly instantiate the template for many different 
types, and we need to manually list all the types you want to use, which can 
be error-prone.

2.Explain why it was necessary for you to add the members that you added into 
the Book class.
The added members and member functions in the Book class are necessary to represent, 
initialize, and display book information. They align with the requirements of the 
project, which involve managing Book-type objects within the Collection and 
OrderedCollection modules and printing them in a specific format.

3. 
T getSmallestItem(): returns the current smallest item stored in the class attribute.
T getLargestItem(): returns the current largest item stored in the class attribute.
Explain why these functions cannot be querries, even though they do not change value.

While getSmallestItem() and getLargestItem() do not change the internal state of the 
Collection class, they involve retrieving and returning data stored within the class. 
These functions are considered queries because they provide access to information 
about the collection's state, even though they don't modify it.

4.Discuss if we can make this function a query or not.
The operator[] function in the OrderedCollection class can be a query. It provides 
read-only access to elements in the collection and does not modify the internal 
state of the collection.

5. - What is the reason for defining the class objects outside the class definition?
	By defining these objects outside the class definition, you can specialize 
them for specific template arguments (e.g., T = Book and C = 10) in a way that would 
not be possible if they were directly defined as static members within the class. 
    - What is the reason for specializing the definition of m_smallestItem and 
m_largestItem objects for Book and 10?
	Specializing the definition of m_smallestItem and m_largestItem objects for 
T = Book and C = 10 is a way to provide default values or behaviors for these objects 
=> handle specific cases where it makes sense to have predefined values or behaviors 
based on the template arguments, ensuring that the objects are correctly initialized 
for specific scenarios.
    - m_smallestItem and m_largestItem objects are also initialized for Book and 72. 
Is this initilization necessary? Why?
	I think it's necessary because initializing m_smallestItem and m_largestItem 
objects for T = Book and C = 72 follows a similar logic as the specialization for 
T = Book and C = 10.
